                </header>
                <p>An Arab Muslim scholar, he differed from which body the Azd is attributed. He excelled in the sciences of chemistry, astronomy, engineering, mineralogy, philosophy, medicine and pharmacology, and Jaber bin Hayyan is considered the first
                    to use chemistry in practice. He was born according to the most famous narrations in the year 101 AH / 721 AD and it was also said 117 AH / 737 AD that he was an Arab scholar. Perhaps this affiliation is the result of a similarity
                    in the names. Jaber, who is attributed to Andalusia, is the Arab astronomer Jabir bin Aflah, who was born in Seville and lived in the twelfth century AD. Some say that he was born in the city of Tus in the state of Persia from the
                    works of Khorasan, and Zaki Najib Mahmoud believes that he was born in Kufa, which was suggested by a number of other academic studies. At the beginning of the tenth century AD, the identity and actions of Jabir ibn Hayyan were the
                    subject of great controversy in Islamic circles. His books in the fourteenth century were among the most important sources of chemical studies and the most influential in leading scientific thought in the East and the West. Several
                    scientific terms were transferred from Jaber’s Arabic researches to European languages ​​through the Latin language to which his research was translated and he was known as “Geber” or “Yeber.” . Ibn Khaldun described it in his introduction
                    as he was about to talk about the science of chemistry. He said: “The imam of bloggers is Jabir ibn Hayyan, so much so that they single her out for it, so they call it the science of Jaber, and in it there are seventy treatises, all
                    of which are like riddles.” Abu Bakr al-Razi said about him in “The Secret of the Secrets”: “Jaber is one of the geniuses of the Arabs and the first pioneer of chemistry,” and he was constantly referring to him by saying Professor
                    Jaber bin Hayyan. Ibn al-Nadim mentioned in al-Fihrist his writings and a brief description of him, and the English philosopher Francis Bacon said about him: “Jaber ibn Hayyan was the first to teach the science of chemistry to the
                    world. He is the father of chemistry.” Jabir ibn Hayyan has in chemistry what Aristotle had in logic. That is, like when Aristotle excelled in philosophy and was brilliant with it, as was the case with Jabir Ibn Hayyan in chemistry.</p>

                <h3 style="color: brown;">His life</h3>
                <p>An imaginary picture of Ibn Hayyan Some sources mentioned that Jaber is the son of Hayyan bin Abdullah Al-Azdi, whose family emigrated from Yemen to Kufa, and he was born there and worked as a pharmacist in Kufa. His father was a supporter
                    of the Abbasids in their revolt against the Umayyads, who sent him to Khorasan to call on the people to support them. He was arrested and killed by the Umayyads, so his family fled to Yemen, where Jaber grew up and studied the Qur’an
                    and other sciences and practiced his father’s profession. Then his family returned to Kufa, after the Abbasids had removed the Umayyads, so it is sometimes attributed to the Azdi, the Kufic, the Tusi, or the Sufi. Some sources differed
                    as to whether he was an Azdi Arab or a Persian. While Henry Corbin believes that Jaber bin Hayyan was not an Arab, but was a loyalist of the Azd tribe, and among his contemporaries was Zaki Najeeb Mahmud, who determined his true Arab
                    Azdi origin. There he joined the circle of Jaafar al-Sadiq, and received his forensic, linguistic and chemical sciences at his hands. He also studied at the hands of al-Himyari, despite some doubts that Jabir was a student at the hands
                    of Jaafar al-Sadiq. Some researchers believe that Jafar al-Sadiq himself met Khalid bin Yazid bin Muawiyah and took chemistry from him. This information has been obscured by some historians for political and doctrinal reasons. Then
                    Jaber practiced medicine at the beginning of his life under the auspices of the Minister Jaafar Al-Barmaki and under the guidance of the Abbasid Caliph Harun Al-Rashid. Anwar al-Rifai described him in his book History of Science in
                    Islam: He was tall, with a thick beard. He was famous for his faith and piety, as well as for his mysticism. Jaber Ibn Hayyan lived in the old city of Damascus, where he spent most of the day in a secluded room studying chemistry.
                    In the year 987, Ibn al-Nadim translated Ibn Hayyan in al-Fihrist that he was one of the companions of Ja`far al-Sadiq, and he also indicated that the group of philosophers claimed that Jabir was one of its members. Ibn Wahshiyah also
                    said about him that "Jaber bin Hayyan is a Sufi... and his book on poisons is a great work...". While others questioned the proportion of writing to him. Jaber died at the age of ninety in Kufa after he fled there from the Abbasids
                    after the catastrophe of al-Baramkeh. He was imprisoned in Kufa and remained in prison until his death in 197 AH (813) and it was also said 195 AH/810 AD. She was called by many titles, including "The Great Professor", "Sheikh of Muslim
                    Alchemists", "Father of Chemistry", "The Sublime Saint of Sufism" and "King of India". As well as the title of the science of chemistry in relation to the workmanship of Jaber.</p>

                <h3 style="color: brown;">his contributions</h3>
                <p>He is credited with inventing and preparing a number of acids, including sulfuric acid, which he called Zag oil. The total contributions attributed to Ibn Hayyan amounted to nearly 3,000 manuscripts. However, the Jewish Arabist Paul Krause
                    saw that several hundred of these works belong to several people, and that Most of them date from the late ninth and early tenth centuries, and some scholars believe that many of these works are merely commentaries and additions by
                    his students. However, this idea was rejected by other scholars, led by the American scientist and historian Syed Numan al-Haq, who believed that Paul Krause had miscalculated and miscalculated in reviewing the work of Jabir ibn Hayyan,
                    and mentioned three errors in Krause’s methodology that led him to this error. " These contributions included works on cosmology, music, medicine, magic, biology, chemical techniques, engineering, grammar, metaphysics, logic, and astronomy.
                    Some of his works on alchemy were translated into Latin in the Middle Ages, and were widely spread among medieval European alchemists. Jaber ibn Hayyan was influenced by the writings of ancient Egyptian alchemists and Greeks, such
                    as Zozimus al-Akhmimi, Democritus, Hermes al-Harames and Agathodemon, and even the writings of Plato, Aristotle, Galen, Pythagoras, Socrates, and Alexander's comments from Aphrodisias, Simplicius, Pharurius and others. There was also
                    a huge body of semi-literary writings on chemistry written in Arabic, with the names of Persian writers such as Gamasp, Austane, and Mani, who mentioned in them their experiments with metals and other substances. This is also evidenced
                    by the large number of words with Persian roots such as mercury and ammonia, which show the Arabs' dependence on Persian alchemy. Ibn al-Nadim also transmitted a dialogue between Aristotle and the alchemist Ostans al-Farsi, which was
                    mentioned by Jabir ibn Hayyan in his book "Aristotelian Corrections". The orientalist Julius Ruska also believed that the Sassanid medical schools played an important role in the spread of interest in alchemy. Among the most important
                    scientific contributions of Jaber in chemistry is the introduction of the experimental method to chemistry, and he is the inventor of the alkali known in modern chemistry terms by its Arabic name (Alkali), and silver water. He introduced
                    the elements of experiment and laboratory into chemistry, and recommended thorough research, reliance on experiment, and patience in carrying out it. Jaber is considered one of the pioneers of applied sciences. His contributions in
                    this field are reflected in metal refining, steel preparation, fabric dyeing, leather tanning, waterproofing cloth coating, and the use of manganese dioxide in glass making.</p>

                <h3 style="color: brown;">Chemistry in his time</h3>

                <p>Chemistry began to be fairy based on outdated myths, where the idea of ​​converting cheap metals into precious metals prevailed, because scientists in pre-Islamic civilizations believed that ignited metals such as gold, silver, copper,
                    iron, lead and tin were of one kind, and that their contrast stems from heat, cold, dryness and latent moisture It has variable symptoms (relative to the theory of the four elements, fire, air, water and earth), so these minerals can
                    be transformed from each other by a third substance, which is the elixir. From this point of view, some scholars of previous civilizations of Islamic civilization imagined that it was possible to invent the elixir of life or the stone
                    of wisdom that removes the ills of life and prolongs life. Illustrative examples of the various experiments and tools used by Jabir ibn Hayyan Some early Arab and Muslim scholars, such as Jabir bin Hayyan and Abu Bakr Al-Razi, were
                    influenced by the theory of the four elements that Arab and Muslim scholars inherited from Greece. But they made a careful scientific study of it; This study led to the development and application of the experimental scientific method
                    in the field of experimental sciences. The attempt to know the validity of the theory of the four elements helped Arab and Muslim scientists to identify a very large number of chemical substances, as well as knowledge of some chemical
                    reactions, so to Muslim scholars the credit is due to the development of the discovery of some simple chemical processes such as: distillation, sublimation, filtration, crystallization, amalgamation and oxidation. With these simple
                    operations, geniuses in the field of chemistry were able to invent various machines for scientific experiments that led modern-day scientists to the conquest of space.</p>
