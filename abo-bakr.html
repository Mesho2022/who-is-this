                    <h2><mark style="color: blue;">Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi</mark> <sup>(250 AH/864 AD - 5 Shaban 311 AH / November 19, 923 AD)</sup></h3>
                </header>
                <p>Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn Zakaria al-Razi was a Muslim physician, chemist, philosopher and mathematician who was one of the scholars of the golden age of science. », where he wrote the book Al-Hawi on Medicine, which included all
                    medical knowledge from the days of the Greeks until 925 AD and remained the main medical reference in Europe for 400 years after that date, studying mathematics, medicine, philosophy, astronomy, chemistry, logic and literature. In
                    Al-Ray, Al-Razi became famous and traveled the country and worked as head of a hospital. He had many letters in various fields of diseases and wrote in all branches of medicine and knowledge at that time, some of which were translated
                    into Latin so that the main references in medicine continued until the seventeenth century. Among his greatest books are “History of Medicine” and a book Al-Mansour in Medicine and the book “Al-Dawaa al-Mufradah” which includes an
                    accurate description of the anatomy of the body’s organs. He was the first to invent surgical threads, make ointments, and has books on pharmacology that contributed to the advancement of pharmacology. He has 200 books and articles
                    on various aspects of science.</p>

                <h3 style="color: brown;">His life and upbringing</h3>
                <p>There are different and conflicting opinions about the life of Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn Zakaria al-Razi, who is believed to have been born in the city of Rayy, near modern Tehran. Most likely, he was born in the year 251 AH / 865
                    AD. Al-Razi was of the opinion that students should learn the medical industry in the large crowded cities, where there were many patients and skilled doctors practiced their profession. Therefore, Rayan spent his youth in the city
                    of peace, and studied medicine in Baghdad. Historians have mistakenly assumed that Al-Razi learned medicine after he was old. And I came to know this fact from a text in a manuscript in the Bodley Library in Oxford, entitled “Experiences”
                    from what Muhammad ibn Baghdad wrote in his youth, and this text was published accompanied by excerpts on the same subject, which I quoted from the books of Al-Razi that he wrote after his experience was completed, and in which his
                    style bears witness his own opinion. After completing his medical studies in Baghdad, Al-Razi returned to the city of Rayy at the invitation of its ruler, Mansur bin Ishaq, to ​​take over the management of Al Ray Hospital. Al-Razi
                    wrote for this ruler his book “Al-Mansoori fi Al-Tibb” and then “Al-Tibb Al-Ruhani” and both complement the other. The first is concerned with diseases of the body, and the second with diseases of the soul. Then he moved again to Baghdad
                    to take over the presidency of the new Al-Mutadidi, which was established by the Caliph Al-Mutadidi Billah (279-289 AH/892-902AD). Accordingly, Ibn Abi Isaiba’a made a mistake when he said that Al-Razi was a Sa’our, the Al-Addi Hospital,
                    which was established by Adud Al-Dawla (died in 372 AH / 973 AD), then Ibn Abi Isaiba’a corrected his mistake by saying: Ibn Abi Asba’a al-Bimaristan al-Muta’didi at all in his lengthy article on al-Razi. He held prestigious positions
                    in irrigation and traveled, but spent the last part of his life in the city of irrigation, and he had blue water in his eyes, then lost his sight and died in his hometown either in the year 313 AH / 923 AD, or in the year 320 AH /
                    932 AD. Al-Razi’s humility and austerity in the course of his life becomes clear to us from his words in the book “The Philosophical Biography” where he says: “Neither did he appear from me on his evil in collecting money and his extravagance
                    in it, nor on people’s disputes, quarrels, and injustice, but it is known from me against all that and my evasion of many of my rights. As for my situation in my restaurant, drink, and amusement, then those who watch this a lot from
                    me may know that I have not gone beyond the extremes of excess, as well as in all my other conditions of clothing, vehicle, servant or maidservant, and in the first chapter of his book “The Spiritual Medicine”, in “The Excellence and
                    Praise of Reason” Al-Razi asserts that the intellect is the supreme reference to which we refer, “and we do not make him, and he is the ruler, judged, nor is he the reins, bound nor, and he is the one who is followed, a follower, rather
                    we refer to him in matters and consider them by him and rely on him.” The physician in the era of al-Razi was a philosopher, and philosophy was a balance by which scientific matters and theories were weighed that doctors recorded in
                    ancient manuscripts over the years. The quality. He defends the philosophical biography of Socrates, saying: [Explain who is meant?] They only mention the first period of Socrates' life, when he was an ascetic and followed the path
                    of hermits. Then he adds that he had given himself to science at the beginning of his life because he sincerely loved philosophy, but after that he lived a normal life.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Al-Razi was a believer in the continuation of progress in medical research, and this can not be achieved, according to him, except by studying the books of the early ones. A lot of things are attached to it, even if he spends all of his
                    life in it, because its amount is much longer than the amount of human life. Not only this industry, but most industries as well. But whoever has attained this industry to this end over thousands of years has realized thousands of
                    men. If Al-Muqtada follows their example, he will reach them all to him in a short time. And it became like the age of those years and those cares. And if he does not look at their perception, how much can he see in his age. And how
                    much is his experience and extraction, even if he is the smartest and most careful people in this field. However, whoever does not look at books and does not understand the image of the illness in himself before seeing it, even though
                    he has seen it many times, he neglected it and passed it by forgiving and did not know it at all.” A time he would have been better than Hippocrates.” He made contributions in the field of physical sciences, as Al-Razi worked in determining
                    the specific densities of liquids, and classified them as a special scale called the Natural Balance.</p>
                <b>The merit of Al-Razi in chemistry is evident when he divided the materials known in his time into four sections:</b>
                <ul>
