                <p>An English scientist is considered one of the most prominent scientists who contributed to physics and mathematics throughout the ages and one of the symbols of the scientific revolution. Newton served as President of the Royal Society
                    and was a member of the English Parliament, in addition to holding the Presidency of the Royal Mint and a Fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge, and is the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.
                    His Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, perhaps the most important single work ever published in the natural sciences, first published in 1687, established most of the principles of classical mechanics. Newton also made
                    important contributions to the field of optics, and Gottfried Leibniz co-founded the foundations of calculus. Newton formulated the laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation that dominated scientists' view of the physical
                    universe for the next three centuries until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. He also proved that the motion of bodies on Earth and celestial bodies can be described according to the same principles of motion and gravity.
                    By deriving Kepler's laws from his mathematical description of gravity, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric theory as a model of the universe. Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope,
                    developed a theory of color based on his observations using a prism-dispersive analysis of white light into the colors of the visible spectrum, formulated a practical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound. In addition to his
                    founding of calculus, Newton also contributed to the study of power series and binomial theorem, and developed Newton's method for approximating roots of functions. Newton was a devout Christian, but in an unorthodox way, he refused
                    to accept the sacred teachings of Anglicanism, perhaps because he refused to believe in the doctrine of the Trinity. Newton also spent considerable time studying alchemy and Old Testament historiography, but most of his work in these
                    areas remained unpublished long after his death.</p>
                <h3 style="color: brown;">Early life</h3>

                <p>Isaac Newton was born (according to the Julian calendar in use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (NS 4 January 1643), "an hour or two after midnight", at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet
                    in the county of Lincolnshire. His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before. Born prematurely, Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug. When
                    Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough (née Blythe). Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained
                    some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: "Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them." Newton's mother had three children
                    (Mary, Benjamin and Hannah) from her second marriage. From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King's School, Grantham, which taught Latin and Ancient Greek and probably imparted a significant
                    foundation of mathematics. He was removed from school and returned to Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth by October 1659. His mother, widowed for the second time, attempted to make him a farmer, an occupation he hated. Henry Stokes, master
                    at The King's School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school. Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student, distinguishing himself mainly by building sundials and models
                    of windmills. In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, on the recommendation of his uncle Rev William Ayscough, who had studied there. He started as a subsizar—paying his way by performing valet's duties—until he
                    was awarded a scholarship in 1664, guaranteeing him four more years until he could get his MA. At that time the college's teachings were based on those of Aristotle, whom Newton supplemented with modern philosophers such as Descartes
                    and astronomers such as Galileo and Thomas Street, through whom he learned of Kepler's work.[citation needed] He set down in his notebook a series of "Quaestiones" about mechanical philosophy as he found it. In 1665, he discovered
                    the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus. Soon after Newton had obtained his BA degree in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the Great
                    Plague. Although he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student, Newton's private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the subsequent two years saw the development of his theories on calculus, optics, and the law of gravitation.
                    In April 1667, he returned to Cambridge and in October was elected as a fellow of Trinity. Fellows were required to become ordained priests, although this was not enforced in the restoration years and an assertion of conformity to
                    the Church of England was sufficient. However, by 1675 the issue could not be avoided and by then his unconventional views stood in the way. Nevertheless, Newton managed to avoid it by means of special permission from Charles II. His
                    studies had impressed the Lucasian professor Isaac Barrow, who was more anxious to develop his own religious and administrative potential (he became master of Trinity two years later); in 1669 Newton succeeded him, only one year after
                    receiving his MA. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1672.</p>

                <h3 style="color: brown;">its upbringing</h3>
                <p> Isaac Newton was born on December 25, 1642 (according to the Julian calendar in force in England at the time, corresponding to January 4, 1643 according to the modern calendar). On the farm of Woolsthorpe in Woolsthorpe-Clostorworth, in
                    the county of Lincolnshire, three months after the death of his father, a farmer also named Isaac Newton. His mother came in labor and gave birth to her son an hour or two after midnight and the moon was that night a full moon, and
                    because he was born early, he was such a small baby that two women who were looking after his mother were sent to fetch medicine from the neighborhood, but instead of rushing to fetch that medicine they decided to rest On the way,
                    they thought that the new-born child might have died because of his size. Its mum, Hanna Iskoff, described it as a quart. When he was three, his mother remarried and moved to her new husband's house, leaving her son in the care of
                    his maternal grandmother, Margaret Ischoff. Isaac did not love his stepfather, but rather had feelings of hostility towards his mother for marrying him. From the age of twelve to seventeen, Newton joined the King's School in Grantham,
                    and Newton left the school in October 1659, to return to the Walsthorpe farm, where he found his mother had been widowed again, and he found her having planned to make him a farmer like his father, but he hated farming. Henry Stokes,
                    a teacher at the King's School, persuaded his mother to send him back to the school, and Newton was able to continue his education. Driven by revenge on the troubled students, Newton was able to prove that he was the best student in
                    the school. Cambridge psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen considered this evidence that Newton had Asperger's syndrome. Painted portrait of Newton in 1702. In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge as a working student,
                    a system then popular that involved paying the student less than his peers and doing work in return. At that time, the teachings of the College were based on the teachings of Aristotle, which Newton supplemented with the teachings
                    of modern philosophers, Carnet Descartes, and astronomers such as Nicholas Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, and Johannes Kepler. In 1665, Newton discovered the general binomial theorem, and began developing another mathematical theory
                    that later became calculus. Soon after, Newton received his degree in August 1665, and the university was then closed as a temporary precaution against the Great Plague. Although not in Cambridge, Newton's own studies at his home in
                    Woolsthorpe in the next two years saw him develop his theories of calculus, optics, and the law of gravitation. In 1667, he returned to Cambridge and joined Trinity College. The fellowship of the college required that fellows be ordained
                    as priests, which Newton hoped to avoid, as this was inconsistent with his religious views. Fortunately for Newton, there was no set deadline for doing so, and the matter could be postponed indefinitely. The problem then became more
                    acute later when Newton was elected to the prestigious position of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. He had to be ordained to get this job, but he was able to obtain special permission from Charles II, King of England, to exclude
                    him from that. his youth mathematics Newton's works added to most branches of mathematics, perhaps the most important of which was the manuscript published in 1666 AD on the subject of calculus. In a letter to the mathematician John
                    Collins in August 1669, Isaac Barrow described it as "a business of Mr. Newton, a fellow of our college, very young, but an extraordinary genius and adept at such matters." Newton entered into a dispute with Gottfried Leibniz over
                    the precedence of the development of calculus. Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz both independently developed calculus. There are those who say that Newton did not publish almost anything on the subject until 1693,
                    and it was not published in full until 1704, while Leibniz published his entire work in 1684. However, this statement omits what was included in Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy published in 1687, from the foundations
                    and principles of differential and integral calculus, in addition to what was mentioned in his book “On the Motion of Objects in Orbits” published in 1684. However, Newton’s work was based primarily on differential calculus in geometric
                    form, based on specific values ​​for the vanishing ratios of small quantities: His book Mathematical Origins under the title "The Method of First and Last Ratios" explains why he put his explanations in those formulas. For this reason,
                    the Book of Mathematical Origins is described in modern times as “a book brimming with the theory of calculus and its applications.” He also used one or more methods of this calculation in his book on the motion of bodies in orbits
                    in 1684. As well as in his research on motion in the two decades following 1684. Newton hesitated to publish calculus because he was afraid of controversy and criticism. Newton was closely related to the Swiss mathematician Nicolas
                    Fascio de Douyer, who began rewriting Newton's Principia Mathematics in 1691, in accordance with Leibniz's work. However, in 1693, the relationship between Douyer and Newton deteriorated, and the book was not completed. Beginning in
                    1699, other members of the Royal Society (of which Newton was a member) accused Leibniz of plagiarism, and the dispute came to a head in 1711, when the Royal Society declared in a study that Newton was the true discoverer of calculus,
                    and that Leibniz was a fraud. However, this study became an area of ​​doubt, after it was later revealed that Newton himself was the author of that study. Thus began the bitter controversy that marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz,
                    until the latter's death in 1716. He is also credited with Newton's binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. He also discovered Newton's identities and Newton's method, which classifies cubic surfaces curves (polynomials of the third
                    degree in two variables, which made major contributions to the theory of finite differences), and was the first to use fraction symbols and employed analytic geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. near ne</p>

                <h3 style="color: brown;">Mechanics and gravity</h3>
                <p>Mechanics and gravity In 1679, Newton returned to continue his work on celestial mechanics, which includes gravity and its effects on the orbits of the planets, according to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Correspondence between himself
                    and Hooke in 1679–80, after Hooke was appointed director of the Royal Society Correspondence, prompted Newton to continue working in this field, regarding Newton's agreement to simulate Newton's work for the Royal Society. Newton also
                    regained his interest in astronomical questions after the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680/1681, about which he discussed with John Flamsteed. After correspondence with Hooke, Newton demonstrated that the elliptical shape
                    of the planets' orbits was caused by the inversely proportional force of gravity with the square of the radius of the distance. Newton reported his results to Edmund Halley and to the Royal Society in his Treatise on Planetary Motion
                    of about 9 papers transcribed into the Register of the Royal Society in December 1684. This paper contained the kernel that Newton developed and expanded into his Principles of Mathematics for Natural Philosophy. The Mathematical Principles
                    of Natural Philosophy was published on July 5, 1687, with encouragement and financial support from Edmund Halley. And he put in this book (Newton's laws of motion), which helped bring about many developments during the industrial revolution,
                    which quickly became the basis on which non-relativistic techniques are based until the present time. In it, too, he used for the first time the concept of gravity, and defined Newton's law of universal gravitation. He also used a
                    calculus-like method for geometric analysis of 'first and last ratios', with which he arrived at first analytic inference (based on Boyle's law) to estimate the speed of sound in air. He assumed the spherical shape of the Earth, and
                    concluded that the equinoxes resulted from the attraction of the Moon to the Earth, to begin studying the effect of gravity on the irregular motion of the Moon. He also presented a theory for determining the orbits of comets, and other
                    contributions. Newton clearly presented his heliocentric model of the solar system, realizing the deviation of the sun from the center of the solar system. It also denounced that the center of the system or any system in a state of
                    sleep. Newton's assumption of a force capable of acting over vast distances led to him being criticized for claiming that he elicited science. Later, in the second edition of his Mathematical Principles in 1713, Newton vehemently rejected
                    these criticisms in the conclusion to the edition, stating that they rejected the matter without reason, appending his famous phrase "hypotheses non fingo" (I do not make hypotheses). His book Mathematical Principles spread internationally,
                    earning him a number of admirers, including the Swiss-born mathematician Nicolas Fascio de Douyer, with whom a close relationship formed, ending abruptly in 1693 with Newton having a nervous breakdown.</p>


                <h3 style="color: brown;">old age</h3>
                <p> In the last decade of the seventeenth century, Newton wrote religious writings dealing with a literal interpretation of the Bible. It is possible that Henry Moore's beliefs about the universe and rejection of Cartesian dualism may have
                    influenced Newton's religious ideas. Newton sent a manuscript to John Locke questioning the existence of the Trinity, which remained unpublished until 1785, more than half a century after his death. Later, Newton wrote "Chronology
                    of the Ancient Kingdoms" published in 1728, and "Notes on the Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation of St. John" published in 1733, that is, they were published after his death. He also devoted a great deal of his time to the study
                    of alchemy. Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England in 1689-1690 and 1701, but according to some sources, his only comments were to complain about the cold weather and to request that the windows be closed. In 1696, Newton
                    moved to London to take over as director of the Royal Mint. It was then that Newton took charge of reforming and re-minting England's currency. Then Newton became head of the same house after the death of its president, Thomas Neale
                    in 1699, a position that Newton held until his death. Newton was so interested in his new job that he resigned from his university job at Cambridge in 1701. In 1717, in accordance with the Queen Anne Act, Newton managed the process
                    of converting the pound sterling from its silver form to its gold form by determining the exchange value of gold from silver. This caused the old silver pounds to be melted down and shipped out of Britain. In 1703, Newton was elected
                    president of the Royal Society and a fellow of the French Academy of Sciences. In his position as President of the Royal Society, Newton antagonized the royal astronomer John Flamsteed, when he forced him to publish before he finished
                    his astronomical book Describe the Positions of the Stars, the book Newton used in his studies. In April 1705, Queen Anne awarded him the title of Sir during her visit to Trinity College, Cambridge. It is likely that his knighthood
                    was based on political considerations related to the parliamentary elections in May 1705, not in recognition of his scholarly achievements nor of his services to the mint. Newton thus became the second scientist to receive the title
                    after Sir Francis Bacon. Towards the end of his life, Newton resided at Cranbury Park, near Winchester, with his maternal niece and stepfather, until his death in 1727. He was served by his niece, Catherine Barton Conduitt, who served
                    as his housekeeper on Jermaine Street in London, with whom he was very affectionate. Newton died in his sleep in London on 20 March 1727 (31 March 1727 according to the modern calendar), and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Being celibate,
                    Newton spent much of his fortune on relatives during the last years of his life, and died intestate. After his death, Newton's hair was examined and traces of mercury were found, likely from his alchemical experiments. Therefore, it
                    is possible to explain Newton's eccentricities in his late life, as he was poisoned by mercury.</p>


                <h3 style="color: brown;">His personal life</h3>
                <p>Although it is difficult to prove, Newton is known to have died a virgin, according to mathematician Charles Hutton, economist John Maynard Keynes, and physicist Carl Sagan. The French writer and philosopher Voltaire, who was in London
                    at the time of Newton's funeral, claimed this information to be certain, writing: "The doctor and surgeon who were with him at the time of death confirmed this to me" (they said he told them on his deathbed). In 1733, Voltaire publicly
                    declared that Newton "had no desire, or inclination, for any woman". Newton was a close friend of the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fascio de Douyer, whom he met in London around 1690. Their relationship broke off suddenly and for no
                    apparent reason in 1693.</p>
                <h3 style="color: brown;">Laws of Motion</h3>

                <p>In his book Mathematical Principles, Newton laid down the famous three laws of motion, in which: Newton's first law (also known as the law of inertia) which states that "a body will remain in its state of motion (either complete rest or
                    moving in a straight line at a constant speed) unless acted upon by a force changing it." Newton's second law and its text: "If a force or group of forces acts on a body, it causes an acceleration proportional to the sum of the acting
                    forces, and the proportionality coefficient is the inertial mass of the body." The two laws contradicted Aristotle's physics, which stated that there must be a force for the continuation of motion. The name Newton was honored by giving
                    his name to the unit of force in the international system. Unlike Aristotle's physics, Newton's physics was applicable to the outer universe and earthly forces. The vector nature of Newton's second law established a geometric relationship
                    between the direction of a force and the way an object changes its torque. Before Newton, it was assumed that any planet orbiting the sun needed a force to keep it moving. Newton explained instead that it was sufficient to have an
                    inward attraction from the sun. Even several decades after the publication of his Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, the idea was not universally accepted, and many scholars such as René Descartes favored the vortex theory.</p>
