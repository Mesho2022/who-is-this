                <p>Albert Einstein (German: Albert Einstein)was a German-born physicist (who later gave up German citizenship) Swiss and American, of Jewish parents, best known as the father of relativity for being the author of the famous special relativity
                    and general relativity Which were the first building blocks of modern theoretical physics, and in 1921 he won the Nobel Prize in Physics for a research paper on the photoelectric effect, among three hundred other scientific papers
                    of him in the equivalence of matter and energy (E=mc²), quantum mechanics, and others, and his proven conclusions led to the interpretation of many One of the scientific phenomena that classical physics failed to prove. Einstein began
                    with "special relativity" that contradicted Newton's theory of time and space to solve in particular the problems of the old theory regarding electromagnetic waves in general, and light in particular, and that was between (1902-1909)
                    in Switzerland. As for "general relativity", he put it forward in 1915, in which he discussed gravity, and it represents the current description of gravity in modern physics. General relativity generalizes both special relativity and
                    Newton's law of universal gravitation, by providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. Einstein lived in Switzerland between the years (1895 - 1914), except for one year in Prague,
                    and obtained his academic diploma from the Swiss Federal Technical School in Zurich in 1900. He obtained Swiss citizenship in 1901, which he retained for the rest of his life after becoming stateless For more than five years. In 1905,
                    he received a doctorate from the University of Zurich. In the same year, he published four groundbreaking papers (the year was called the "Miracle Year") that took him into the academic world at the age of twenty-six. Einstein taught
                    theoretical physics in Zurich (1912 - 1914) before leaving for Berlin, where he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. In 1933, when Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power. Because of Einstein's
                    Jewish background, Einstein did not return to Germany. He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt alerting him to the potential
                    development of "nuclear bombs" and recommending that the United States begin similar research. This eventually led to the Manhattan Project. Einstein supported the Allied forces, but generally deplored the idea of ​​using nuclear fission
                    as a weapon. He signed the Russell-Einstein Manifesto with British philosopher Bertrand Russell, which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey,
                    until his death in 1955.</p>
                <h3 style="color: brown;">his life</h3>
                <p>his life Einstein's house in Aarau Albert Einstein at age 14 in 1893. Albert Einstein was born in the German city of Ulm on March 14, 1879 to Jewish parents and spent his teenage years in Munich. His father, "Hermann Einstein", was working
                    in the sale of feathers used in the manufacture of pillows, and his mother, "Ne Pauline Koch", worked with him in managing a small workshop for the manufacture of electrical tools after he gave up the profession of selling feathers.
                    Einstein delayed the child in pronunciation until the age of three, but he showed a great passion for nature, and the ability to understand difficult mathematical concepts, and he studied alone Euclidean geometry, and despite his affiliation
                    to Judaism, Einstein entered a Catholic preparatory school and received lessons in playing the violin. At the age of five, his father gave him a compass, and Einstein realized at the time that there is a force in space that affects
                    the compass needle and moves it. Einstein has always excelled in mathematics and physics since his childhood, reaching a mathematical level that exceeds his peers by years. At the age of twelve, Einstein himself learned algebra and
                    Euclidean geometry over the course of one summer. He presented his own theorem while he was still at that age for the correctness of the Pythagorean Theorem. Family teacher Max Talmud, better known as Talmy, says that after giving
                    12-year-old Einstein a textbook on geometry, If he knows what is in the book within a short period. Einstein later devoted himself to advanced mathematics. Einstein's very high mathematical genius made it difficult for my students
                    to be able to teach him. When Einstein was twelve years old, his passion for geometry and algebra led him to a self-convinced belief that nature could be understood as a mathematical construct. Einstein began teaching himself calculus
                    at the age of twelve, and says of himself that he mastered calculus problems at the age of fourteen. At the age of 13, Einstein became acquainted with the works of Kant in his critique of pure reason, and became his favorite philosopher,
                    his teacher says: "At that time he was still a child, and he was only thirteen years old, but he formed a clear and clear idea of ​​Kant's usually incomprehensible works for ordinary people." Two of Einstein's uncles took care of him
                    and supported this child's interest in science in general, providing him with books related to science and mathematics. After the repeated losses of the workshop established by his parents in 1894, his family moved to the city of Pavia
                    in Italy, and Einstein Jr. took advantage of the opportunity to withdraw from the school in Munich, where he hated the strict regime and the suffocating spirit. Then Einstein spent a year with his parents in Milan until it became clear
                    that he had to determine his way in life, so he finished his secondary studies in the Swiss city of Aarau, and then submitted to the exams of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich in 1895, and Einstein loved the methods
                    of teaching in it, and he was often He took his time to study physics alone, or to play his violin, until he passed exams and graduated in 1900, but his teachers did not recommend him to enter the university. Einstein had given up
                    his German official papers in 1896, in order not to perform the military service that he strongly hated, which made him without identity proof of identity or affiliation to any particular country, and in 1898, Einstein met Milva Maric,
                    his Serbian colleague on the bench. He fell in love with her, and during the study period he was discussing with his close friends about scientific topics. After graduating in 1900, Einstein worked as a substitute teacher, and in the
                    following year he obtained the right to Swiss citizenship, and had an illegitimate daughter from his girlfriend, whom they named (Licerle) in January of the year 1901.</p>
                <h3 style="color: brown;">his work</h3>
                <p>Currency Einstein's work in the Swiss registry became permanent, and he prepared for his doctoral thesis in the same period, and he was able to obtain his doctorate in 1905 from the University of Zurich, the thesis topic revolved around
                    the dimensions of molecules, and in the same year Einstein wrote 4 scientific articles without referring to many references Scientific articles or even consulting with fellow academics, these scientific articles are considered the
                    first building block of modern physics as we know it today. In the first paper, Einstein studied what is known as Brownian motion, and made many predictions about the motion of randomly distributed particles in a fluid. Einstein was
                    known as the "father of relativity", that theory that shook the world scientifically, but the Nobel Prize was awarded to him in another field (the photoelectric effect), which was the subject of the second paper. One of his greatest
                    achievements was his discovery of gravitational waves, which cannot be seen, but can be inferred from their effects, and which often appear when massive objects in space move with force. One of his speculations is his belief that it
                    is impossible to measure the instantaneous velocity of nanoparticles that randomly vibrate in different directions in what is known as Brownian motion. But a century later, a scientist named Mark Riesen was able to refute this saying
                    in practice in his research laboratory at the University of Texas and was able to measure the instantaneous speed of these particles, in the midst of his tests of the law of equal distribution, which states that the kinetic energy
                    of a particle depends only on its heat and not on its mass Or its size and, thanks to these tests, experimentally confirmed the correctness of the law on Brownian bodies. During an interview with a newspaper in Pittsburgh, Einstein
                    downplayed scientists' ability to split atoms by releasing protons, describing it as shooting sparrows at night in a country where there are few sparrows. This was refuted by Fermi and his comrades 10 years later when they cracked
                    the atom and built the nuclear bomb.</p>
                <h3 style="color: brown;">his personal life</h3>
                <p>In 1906, Einstein was promoted in the career ladder from the rank of a first-class laboratory technician examiner to the rank of a second-class technical examiner, and in 1908 he was granted leave to give lessons and lectures from "Bern"
                    in Switzerland, and Einstein's second child, who was named "Edward", was born on July 28, 1910 The marriage had been strained since 1912, when Einstein began speaking to his cousin Elsa, and they began regular correspondence. Soon
                    after settling in Berlin, Einstein then insisted on harsh terms for his wife Milva if she were to stay with him in Berlin. In 1914 she brought the boys back to Zurich, and the phase of agreeing to a divorce began after Albert's harsh
                    treatment of his wife. Einstein was legally obligated to send an annual amount of 5,600 Reichs in quarterly installments, just under half his salary. After five years of the required separation period, the couple officially separated
                    and Einstein divorced his wife Mileva on February 14, 1919, and then married his cousin "Elsa Einstein" who is three years older than him on June 2, 1919. No one knows until this hour anything about the fate of Einstein's first illegitimate
                    child from his wife Mileva, as some believe that she died in infancy, and others believe that her parents gave her to those who have no children for adoption. As for Einstein's children, "Edward" has schizophrenia. Personal, and later
                    died in the mental hospital, which took care of him. As for Hans, he was a hydraulic engineer with a research on sediment transport, moved to California to live there and then became a professor at the university, and his contacts
                    with his father were very limited. In 1914, just before World War I, Einstein settled in the German city of "Berlin." The global level after the American "Time" magazine came out on November 7, 1919 with an article confirming the validity
                    of his theory of gravity.</p>
