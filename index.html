                <p class="thomas">Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman. While managing his company, Edison General Electric, before its merger with Thomson Houston Electric, he invented many devices that had
                    a great impact on humanity around the world, such as: the development of the phonograph and cinematographic machine, as well as the practical long-lasting incandescent light bulb. He also developed several devices such as electric
                    power generator, mass communication, sound recording and motion pictures, implemented the principle of mass production, organized science and large-scale teamwork for the invention process, and established the Menlo Park Industrial
                    Research Laboratory in 1876. Edison holds 1,093 US patents bearing his name, as well as numerous patents in France and Germany. His work in these advanced fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator. Edison
                    developed the electric power generation system and distributed it to homes, companies and factories, which led to a fundamental development in the world of modern industries. His first electric power plant, located on Burrill Street,
                    Manhattan, New York, was the Burrill Street Station. Edison established his first laboratory in Menlo Park (NJ), and later established a botanical laboratory in Fort Myers (Florida) in collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and
                    Harvey S. Firestone, also established a laboratory in West Orange (New Jersey), and also established the world's first Black Maria film studio in the same location. Edison was married twice and had 6 children. He died in 1931 of complications
                    from diabetes.</p>

                <p>An English scientist is considered one of the most prominent scientists who contributed to physics and mathematics throughout the ages and one of the symbols of the scientific revolution. Newton served as President of the Royal Society
                    and was a member of the English Parliament, in addition to holding the Presidency of the Royal Mint and a Fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge, and is the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.
                    His Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, perhaps the most important single work ever published in the natural sciences, first published in 1687, established most of the principles of classical mechanics. Newton also made
                    important contributions to the field of optics, and Gottfried Leibniz co-founded the foundations of calculus. Newton formulated the laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation that dominated scientists' view of the physical
                    universe for the next three centuries until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. He also proved that the motion of bodies on Earth and celestial bodies can be described according to the same principles of motion and gravity.
                    By deriving Kepler's laws from his mathematical description of gravity, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric theory as a model of the universe. Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope,
                    developed a theory of color based on his observations using a prism-dispersive analysis of white light into the colors of the visible spectrum, formulated a practical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound. In addition to his
                    founding of calculus, Newton also contributed to the study of power series and binomial theorem, and developed Newton's method for approximating roots of functions. Newton was a devout Christian, but in an unorthodox way, he refused
                    to accept the sacred teachings of Anglicanism, perhaps because he refused to believe in the doctrine of the Trinity. Newton also spent considerable time studying alchemy and Old Testament historiography, but most of his work in these
                    areas remained unpublished long after his death.</p>

                <p>Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, physicist, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist, best known for his contributions to the design of the main alternating current system. Tesla gained experience in telephony
                    and electrical engineering before immigrating to the United States in 1884 to work for Thomas Edison in New York City. Tesla soon separated from Edison and established his laboratories and companies to develop a number of electrical
                    devices. George Westinghouse bought the rights to exploit Tesla's patent for the induction motor and transformer, and Westinghouse appointed him for a short time as his advisor. Tesla's years-long work to develop electric power was
                    part of the "war of currents" between AC and DC proponents, as well as the Patent War. In 1891, Tesla obtained US citizenship. Tesla continued to work on his ideas about wireless lighting, electrical distribution at high voltage, and
                    high-frequency power experiments, and in 1893 AD stated that wireless communication with his devices could be made. Tesla tried to implement his ideas by trying to make an intercontinental radio transmission, in his unfinished project,
                    the Wardencliffe Tower. In his laboratory, he conducted a series of experiments on oscillators, mechanical generators, electrical drain tubes, and preliminary attempts at X-ray imaging. He also built a radio-controlled boat, a unique
                    event at the time. Tesla was best known for his accomplishments and appearances that eventually earned him a reputation in popular culture as a "mad scientist". His patents earned him a great deal of money, much of which he spent to
                    fund his own projects, with varying success. Tesla lived most of his life in a chain of New York hotels until his retirement. Tesla died on January 7, 1943 AD. Tesla's work was mentioned relatively after his death, until 1960 when
                    the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the international unit for measuring the density of the magnetic field, Tesla, in his honor. Since the 1990s, there has been a renewed interest in Tesla and his business.</p>

                <p>Albert Einstein (German: Albert Einstein)was a German-born physicist (who later gave up German citizenship) Swiss and American, of Jewish parents, best known as the father of relativity for being the author of the famous special relativity
                    and general relativity Which were the first building blocks of modern theoretical physics, and in 1921 he won the Nobel Prize in Physics for a research paper on the photoelectric effect, among three hundred other scientific papers
                    of him in the equivalence of matter and energy (E=mc²), quantum mechanics, and others, and his proven conclusions led to the interpretation of many One of the scientific phenomena that classical physics failed to prove. Einstein began
                    with "special relativity" that contradicted Newton's theory of time and space to solve in particular the problems of the old theory regarding electromagnetic waves in general, and light in particular, and that was between (1902-1909)
                    in Switzerland. As for "general relativity", he put it forward in 1915, in which he discussed gravity, and it represents the current description of gravity in modern physics. General relativity generalizes both special relativity and
                    Newton's law of universal gravitation, by providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. Einstein lived in Switzerland between the years (1895 - 1914), except for one year in Prague,
                    and obtained his academic diploma from the Swiss Federal Technical School in Zurich in 1900. He obtained Swiss citizenship in 1901, which he retained for the rest of his life after becoming stateless For more than five years. In 1905,
                    he received a doctorate from the University of Zurich. In the same year, he published four groundbreaking papers (the year was called the "Miracle Year") that took him into the academic world at the age of twenty-six. Einstein taught
                    theoretical physics in Zurich (1912 - 1914) before leaving for Berlin, where he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. In 1933, when Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power. Because of Einstein's
                    Jewish background, Einstein did not return to Germany. He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt alerting him to the potential
                    development of "nuclear bombs" and recommending that the United States begin similar research. This eventually led to the Manhattan Project. Einstein supported the Allied forces, but generally deplored the idea of ​​using nuclear fission
                    as a weapon. He signed the Russell-Einstein Manifesto with British philosopher Bertrand Russell, which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey,
                    until his death in 1955.</p>

                <p>An Arab Muslim scholar, he differed from which body the Azd is attributed. He excelled in the sciences of chemistry, astronomy, engineering, mineralogy, philosophy, medicine and pharmacology, and Jaber bin Hayyan is considered the first
                    to use chemistry in practice. He was born according to the most famous narrations in the year 101 AH / 721 AD and it was also said 117 AH / 737 AD that he was an Arab scholar. Perhaps this affiliation is the result of a similarity
                    in the names. Jaber, who is attributed to Andalusia, is the Arab astronomer Jabir bin Aflah, who was born in Seville and lived in the twelfth century AD. Some say that he was born in the city of Tus in the state of Persia from the
                    works of Khorasan, and Zaki Najib Mahmoud believes that he was born in Kufa, which was suggested by a number of other academic studies. At the beginning of the tenth century AD, the identity and actions of Jabir ibn Hayyan were the
                    subject of great controversy in Islamic circles. His books in the fourteenth century were among the most important sources of chemical studies and the most influential in leading scientific thought in the East and the West. Several
                    scientific terms were transferred from Jaber’s Arabic researches to European languages ​​through the Latin language to which his research was translated and he was known as “Geber” or “Yeber.” . Ibn Khaldun described it in his introduction
                    as he was about to talk about the science of chemistry. He said: “The imam of bloggers is Jabir ibn Hayyan, so much so that they single her out for it, so they call it the science of Jaber, and in it there are seventy treatises, all
                    of which are like riddles.” Abu Bakr al-Razi said about him in “The Secret of the Secrets”: “Jaber is one of the geniuses of the Arabs and the first pioneer of chemistry,” and he was constantly referring to him by saying Professor
                    Jaber bin Hayyan. Ibn al-Nadim mentioned in al-Fihrist his writings and a brief description of him, and the English philosopher Francis Bacon said about him: “Jaber ibn Hayyan was the first to teach the science of chemistry to the
                    world. He is the father of chemistry.” Jabir ibn Hayyan has in chemistry what Aristotle had in logic. That is, like when Aristotle excelled in philosophy and was brilliant with it, as was the case with Jabir Ibn Hayyan in chemistry.</p>

                    the mortality rate of puerperal fever and developed vaccines against rabies and anthrax, and his experiments supported the germ theory of the disease. He was known to the general public for inventing a method for treating milk and
                    wine to prevent them from causing disease, a process he later called pasteurization. Pasteur is considered one of the most important founders of microbiology along with Ferdinand Cohn and Robert Koch. Pasteur also made many discoveries
