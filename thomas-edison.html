                </header>
                <p>Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman. While managing his company, Edison General Electric, before its merger with Thomson Houston Electric, he invented many devices that had
                    a great impact on humanity around the world, such as: the development of the phonograph and cinematographic machine, as well as the practical long-lasting incandescent light bulb. He also developed several devices such as electric
                    power generator, mass communication, sound recording and motion pictures, implemented the principle of mass production, organized science and large-scale teamwork for the invention process, and established the Menlo Park Industrial
                    Research Laboratory in 1876. Edison holds 1,093 US patents bearing his name, as well as numerous patents in France and Germany. His work in these advanced fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator. Edison
                    developed the electric power generation system and distributed it to homes, companies and factories, which led to a fundamental development in the world of modern industries. His first electric power plant, located on Burrill Street,
                    Manhattan, New York, was the Burrill Street Station. Edison established his first laboratory in Menlo Park (NJ), and later established a botanical laboratory in Fort Myers (Florida) in collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and
                    Harvey S. Firestone, also established a laboratory in West Orange (New Jersey), and also established the world's first Black Maria film studio in the same location. Edison was married twice and had 6 children. He died in 1931 of complications
                    from diabetes.</p>
                <h3 style="color: brown;">His Upbringing :</h3>
                <p>Edison was born in Milan, Ohio, and raised in Port Huron, Michigan. He is of Dutch descent. He was the seventh and last son of Samuel Edison (1804-1896) and Nancy Matthews Elliott (1810-1871). His father had to flee Canada due to his participation
                    in the failed Mackenzie Revolution of 1837. Young Edison was often absent-minded at school, described by his teacher as "rotten". Edison completed three months of formal schooling. Edison later recalls: "My mother made me, she believed
                    in me; I felt my life had a purpose, someone I could not let down." His mother taught him at home. His reading of Parker's scholarly books on natural philosophy greatly contributed to his education. Edison developed hearing problems
                    at an early age, and his deafness was attributed to repeated bouts of scarlet fever during childhood without treatment for middle ear infections. During the middle of his career, Edison's hearing impairment was said to have been caused
                    by a train operator hitting him in the ears after his chemical lab caught fire in a carriage and he was thrown along with his device and chemicals off the train in Kimball, Michigan. In the last years of his life, Edison modified the
                    story by saying that the accident occurred when a train operator helped him board the train by lifting him by the ears. Edison's family moved to Port Huron, Michigan, in 1854 after a poor job, and his life there was bittersweet. He
                    sold candy and newspapers on trains running from Port Huron to Detroit, as well as vegetables to supplement his income. He also states that he studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until an accident
                    prevented further work. Edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road with four assistants, launching a weekly publication called the Grand Trunk Herald. From this work, Edison embarked on many entrepreneurial
                    projects, as well as discovering his talents as an entrepreneur. These talents eventually led to the creation of 14 companies, including General Electric, which remains one of the world's largest publicly traded companies.</p>
                <h3 style="color: brown;">Beginning of his career</h3>
                <p>Thomas Edison began his career in Nework, New Jersey, where he invented the automatic repeater and other advanced telegraph devices, but the invention that first made him famous was in 1877 when he invented the phonograph. This feat was
                    totally unexpected even by the general public for it to be considered magical. Edison became known as "The Wizard of Menlo Park" in New Jersey. The first phonograph was recorded on a tin drum, but it had poor sound quality and could
                    only make recordings a few times. The model was later recreated using wax-coated cardboard cylinders by Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, and Charles Sumner Tyner. This was one of the reasons that encouraged Thomas Edison to
                    continue working on the "complete phonograph".</p>
                <h3 style="color: brown;"> His Last Years.</h3>
                <p>Edison was an active businessman until his later years. Just a few months before his death he opened monorail and rail service between Hoboken, Montclair, Dover and Gladstone in New Jersey. The electrical power transmission systems for
                    this service using DC were advocated by Edison. The fleet of cars provided passenger service in northern New Jersey for 54 years, until 1984. Edison was said to have been influenced by a popular diet in his later years; "The only liquid
                    he drank was a pint of milk every three hours" It was said that this diet was thought to restore his health, but this is a questionable account. In 1930, one year before Edison's death, Mina said in an interview about him, "Eating
                    the right foods is one of his most important hobbies." She also said that on one of his phased "big science adventures," he would get up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and was rarely home for lunch or dinner. Edison acquired his
                    hometown of Milan, Ohio in 1906. On his last visit, in 1923, he was shocked to find his old home lit with lanterns and candles. Thomas Edison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, at his home (Glenmont) in Llewellyn
                    Park in West Orange, New Jersey, the house he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina, and was buried behind the house. Mina died in 1947.</p>
