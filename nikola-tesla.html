                <p>Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, physicist, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist, best known for his contributions to the design of the main alternating current system. Tesla gained experience in telephony
                    and electrical engineering before immigrating to the United States in 1884 to work for Thomas Edison in New York City. Tesla soon separated from Edison and established his laboratories and companies to develop a number of electrical
                    devices. George Westinghouse bought the rights to exploit Tesla's patent for the induction motor and transformer, and Westinghouse appointed him for a short time as his advisor. Tesla's years-long work to develop electric power was
                    part of the "war of currents" between AC and DC proponents, as well as the Patent War. In 1891, Tesla obtained US citizenship. Tesla continued to work on his ideas about wireless lighting, electrical distribution at high voltage, and
                    high-frequency power experiments, and in 1893 AD stated that wireless communication with his devices could be made. Tesla tried to implement his ideas by trying to make an intercontinental radio transmission, in his unfinished project,
                    the Wardencliffe Tower. In his laboratory, he conducted a series of experiments on oscillators, mechanical generators, electrical drain tubes, and preliminary attempts at X-ray imaging. He also built a radio-controlled boat, a unique
                    event at the time. Tesla was best known for his accomplishments and appearances that eventually earned him a reputation in popular culture as a "mad scientist". His patents earned him a great deal of money, much of which he spent to
                    fund his own projects, with varying success. Tesla lived most of his life in a chain of New York hotels until his retirement. Tesla died on January 7, 1943 AD. Tesla's work was mentioned relatively after his death, until 1960 when
                    the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the international unit for measuring the density of the magnetic field, Tesla, in his honor. Since the 1990s, there has been a renewed interest in Tesla and his business.</p>

                <p>Work for Edison In 1882, Tesla moved to France to work for the Edison Company in Europe, designing and developing electrical appliances. In June 1884, Tesla immigrated to New York in the United States, where Thomas Edison hired him to
                    work for Edison Mechanical Works in Manhattan. Tesla began working with Edison as an electrical engineer, and quickly solved difficult business dilemmas. He was then given the task of redesigning Edison's DC generator. In 1885, Tesla
                    claimed that he could redesign Edison's inefficient generators and mechanisms in a way that ensured good service and economic efficiency. According to Tesla, Edison remarked, "I'll give you fifty thousand dollars if I can." It was
                    a unilateral act by Edison, whose company was underpaid and short of cash. Months later, Tesla accomplished the task and claimed his prize. Edison evaded, claiming he was joking, and replied, "Tesla, you don't seem to understand American
                    humour." In lieu of the prize, Edison offered a weekly bonus of $10 on top of Tesla's $18 weekly salary. Tesla rejected the offer, and immediately quit</p>
                <h3 style="color: brown;">Alternating current and induction motor</h3>
                <p>Alternating current and induction motor US Patent No. 381,968 diagram, which describes the Tesla principle of AC induction motors. In late 1886, Tesla met Western Union supervisor Alfred Brown and Charles Beck, New York's legal commissioner.
                    The two men were familiar with the mechanism of establishing companies, adopting inventions and patents for financial gain, and agreed to finance Tesla financially. The three founded the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887 AD, after
                    they agreed to divide the proceeds of patents by a third for Tesla, a third for his two partners, and a third to be added to the company's capital. They established a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he
                    worked on developing and designing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices. In 1887, Tesla developed an alternating current induction motor, a power system that began to be used in Europe and the United States for
                    its advantages in transmitting high-voltage alternating current over long distances. The motor used a polyphase current that produces a rotating magnetic field to drive the motor. Tesla patented this innovative electric motor in May
                    1888. The motor was designed to operate simply by itself without the need for an electrical exchanger, thus requiring no starting spark and no need for regular maintenance to replace mechanical brushes. In 1888, Thomas Commerford Martin,
                    editor of Electric World magazine, arranged for Tesla to explain his alternating current system and its application to his induction motor to the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (now the Society of Electrical and Electronics
                    Engineers). Engineers at Westinghouse Electric and Industry reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a bright-future AC motor and associated power system, which Westinghouse was looking to patent. Westinghouse was working on
                    obtaining a patent for the induction motor with a rotating magnetic field, a reversing current, which the Italian scientist Galileo Ferrari addressed in a research paper in March 1888 AD, but he believed that the Tesla patent would
                    enable him to dominate the market. Scheme of US Patent No. 390,721 for Tesla's alternating current electric generator obtained in 1888. In July 1888, Brown and Beck negotiated with Westinghouse licensing Westinghouse to use Tesla's
                    designs for a multi-phase induction motor and transformer for $60,000 in cash plus $2.5 for each AC horsepower produced from each motor. Westinghouse also employed Tesla for one year for $2,000 (about $52,700 today) to work as a consultant
                    at the plants of Westinghouse Electric and Industry in Pittsburgh. During that year, Tesla helped produce an alternating current system to power the city's trams. However, Tesla considered this period to be a frustrating period, after
                    colliding with other company engineers when they initially settled on using the 60-cycle alternating current system that Tesla proposed to match the frequency of his engine, but after a short time they found that it was not suitable
                    for the tram, because the tramâ€™s engine Inductive Tesla works at a constant speed only. In the end, they agreed to use a DC motor.</p>
