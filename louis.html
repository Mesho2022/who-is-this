                    <h2><mark style="color: blue;">Louis Pasteur</mark></h3>
                </header>
                <p>(French: Louis Pasteur) was a French chemist and one of the most important founders of microbiology in medicine, known for his distinguished role in the investigation of the causes and prevention of diseases. His medical discoveries reduced
                    the mortality rate of puerperal fever and developed vaccines against rabies and anthrax, and his experiments supported the germ theory of the disease. He was known to the general public for inventing a method for treating milk and
                    wine to prevent them from causing disease, a process he later called pasteurization. Pasteur is considered one of the most important founders of microbiology along with Ferdinand Cohn and Robert Koch. Pasteur also made many discoveries
                    in the field of chemistry, most notably the molecular basis for the asymmetry of certain crystals. His body is located at the Pasteur Institute in Paris in a stunning vault that depicts his achievements in the form of a Byzantine mosaic.</p>

                <h3 style="color: brown;">its upbringing</h3>
                <p> Louis Pasteur was born on December 27, 1822 to a poor family working as an animal tanner in Dole in France and raised in the town of Arbois. This may have instilled in Pasteur the principle of strong patriotism in his youth and later was
                    a defining element of his personality. He was the third son of his father, Jean-Joseph Pasteur, and his mother, Jean-Etienne Roque. His father worked as a sergeant in Napoleon's army, then he practiced tanning. Louis Pasteur was an
                    average student in his early school years, but he excelled in drawing and painting. Later his pastel drawings that he completed when he was 15 and portraits of his parents and friends are kept in the Musée Pasteur Institute in Paris.
                    He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1840 and a Bachelor of Science degree in 1842 from the Ecole Normale Supérieure, and his doctorate in 1847. Pasteur became professor of chemistry at the University of Strasbourg after a brief
                    stint as a physics professor at the Lycée Dijon in 1848, where he met and courted Laurent Marie , the daughter of the university president in 1849. They married on May 29, 1849 and had five children, three of whom died of typhoid.
                    From these personal tragedies, Pasteur drew his desire to find a cure for diseases such as typhoid.</p>
                <h3 style="color: brown;">germ fermentation theory</h3>
                <p>Pasteur showed that the cause of the fermentation process is the growth of microorganisms, and that the emerging growth of bacteria in nutrient fluids is not due to spontaneous generation, but to biogenesis outside the body, as he exposed
                    the boiling liquid to the air in vessels containing a filter to prevent all particles from reaching Medium growth stage with air entering through a long winding tube that does not allow dust particles to pass through. Pasteur noticed
                    that nothing grew in the liquid unless the flasks were broken and opened, so he concluded that organisms such as dust spores that grew in the liquid came from outside rather than automatically generated inside the liquid. This was
                    one of the most important and last experiments to refute the theory of spontaneous generation. This experiment also supported the germ theory of the disease. Pasteur was not the first to come up with the germ theory of disease (it
                    was proposed by Girolamo Fracastro, Agostino Bassi, Frédéric Gustav Jacob Henley and others earlier), but Pasteur did experiments that clearly demonstrated the validity of this theory and was able to convince most of Europe of its
                    validity. Today, together with Robert Koch, Pasteur is considered the originator of the germ theory of disease and bacteriology. Pasteur's research also showed that the growth of microorganisms is responsible for spoiling beverages
                    such as wine, beer and milk. In addition, he created a process in which liquids such as milk were heated to eliminate most of the bacteria and mold already present within it. Pasteur performed the first experiment in collaboration
                    with Claude Bernard on April 20, 1862. Shortly thereafter this process was called pasteurization. Pasteur concluded from the idea of ​​spoiling drinks that microorganisms that infect animals and humans cause diseases. He suggested
                    that microorganisms should be prevented from entering the human body, which led Joseph Lister to develop disinfection techniques in surgery. In 1865, pébrine and flacherie, a parasitic disease, killed large numbers of silkworms in
                    the French Alès region. Pasteur worked over several years to prove that the cause of these diseases was a bacterial attack on the eggs of silkworms, and that eliminating these microbes would in turn eliminate the disease.</p>
                <h3 style="color: brown;">Immunology and vaccination</h3>
                <p>
                    Pasteur's later work involved chicken cholera. During his work, the notion that bacteria were responsible for causing this disease in some poultry failed. By reusing healthy poultry, Pasteur found that he could not infect them, even with new bacteria,
                    so the weakened bacteria gave the poultry immunity to disease, even though it might cause only mild symptoms. His assistant Charles Chamberland (of French descent) was instructed to vaccinate poultry after Pasteur went on vacation,
                    but Chamberland failed to do so and went on vacation as well. After his return, the month-long breeding made the poultry sick, but then they recovered completely rather than being fatal as expected. Chamberland assumed he had made
                    a mistake, and wanted to get rid of the wrong breeding as it seemed to him when Pasteur stopped him. Pasteur concluded that animals who had recovered might have been immune to this disease, as in the case of animals in the French province
                    of Eure and the Loire who had recovered from anthrax. Pasteur applied for the use of this method to vaccinate cattle against anthrax, which sparked interest in combating other diseases. Pasteur claimed to have made an anthrax vaccine
                    by exposing the Bacillus bacteria to oxygen. The notebooks he was using in his laboratory are kept at the National Library in Paris. In fact, Pasteur used the technique of his rival Jean-Joseph-Henri Toussaint, a veterinary surgeon
                    in Toulouse, to create the anthrax vaccine. This method is carried out by the oxidation of potassium dichromate. A vaccine has already been produced by Pasteur's oxidation method after he received a patent for the production of an
                    anthrax vaccine. The concept of acquiring immunity after vaccination with a weakened form of malignant disease was not new, and this concept was known for a long time with smallpox, as vaccination with smallpox led to a reduction in
                    scars and a significantly reduced mortality rate compared to naturally acquired disease. Edward Jenner also discovered vaccination, using cowpox to give immunity to smallpox (in 1796), but the difference from vaccination against smallpox
                    is that vaccination against anthrax or vaccination of poultry against cholera is done by a weakened form (that is, artificially produced) rather than The naturally diminished form. This discovery resulted in a revolution in work on
                    infectious diseases, and Pasteur gave a scientific name to these artificially weakened diseases and named them vaccines in honor of Edward Jenner's discovery. Pasteur produced the first rabies vaccine by growing the virus in rabbits,
                    then weakening them by drying out damaged nerve tissue.</p>
                <h3 style="color: brown;">differences</h3>
                <p>As a 55-year-old French national hero, Pasteur told his family not to reveal his lab notebooks to anyone. His family granted his request, and all his documents were preserved and inherited in secret. Eventually, Pasteur's grandson and
                    the last surviving male descendant, Pasteur Valéry-Radot, donated the papers to the French National Library in 1964. However, historical studies of the papers were restricted until Valéry-Radot's death in 1971, and were not indexed
                    by number until 1985 . Historian of science Gerald L. Gaison in 1995, on the centenary of Louis Pasteur's death, analyzes Pasteur's private notebooks in his book Louis Pasteur's Private Sciences; He said that Pasteur had published
                    several misleading and deceptive accounts about his most notable discoveries. Max Perutz wrote a defense of Pasteur in the New York Review of Books. On the basis of further examinations of Pasteur's documents, the French immunologist
                    Patrice Depre in his book Louis Pasteur (1998) concluded that there were some flaws in Pasteur's genius. One review states that Deprey "at times sees him as unfair, hostile, arrogant, ill-behaved, rigid, and even dogmatic".</p>



                <h3 style="color: brown;">fermentation</h3>
                <p>Scientists studied fermentation before Pasteur; Charles Cagnard-Latour, Frédéric Traugot-Kutzing and Theodor Schwann used microscopes to study yeasts in the 1830s, concluding that they were living organisms. In 1839, Justus von Liebig,
                    Frieders Wöller, and Jöns Jacob Berilius stated that yeast is not a living organism but is produced by the action of air in plant sap. Antoine Beauchamp, a professor of chemistry at the University of Montpellier, experimented with
                    solutions of sucrose in 1855, concluding that water was the leavening agent, but changed this conclusion in 1858, noting that fermentation was directly related to the growth of mold, which needs air to grow. Beauchamp sees himself
                    as the first to demonstrate the role of microorganisms in fermentation. Pasteur began his experiments in 1857 and published his findings in 1858 (in the April issue of Comptes Rendus Chimie, while Beauchamp's paper was published in
                    the January issue). Beauchamp said Pasteur did not offer any new ideas or experiments. On the other hand, Beauchamp may have been aware of Pasteur's initial work in 1857. With both claiming primacy of access to this scientific discovery,
                    controversy that spanned several areas continued throughout their lives. In any event, Beauchamp appears to have lost the race, according to the obituary in The BMJ: "His name has been associated with ancient controversies over precedence
                    over which debate remains futile". Beauchamp proposed the erroneous theory about microzymes. According to you. The. Manchester Anti-biologists and proponents of alternative medicine backed Beauchamp and microzymes, unjustifiably claiming
                    that Pasteur had plagiarized Beauchamp's ideas. Pasteur believed that succinic acid would convert sucrose, but in 1860 Marcellin Berthelot was able to isolate invertase, showing that succinic acid did not convert sucrose. Pasteur thought
                    that fermentation was under the influence of living cells, and he and Bertello entered into a long debate about vitalism, which Bertello strongly opposed. Hans Buchner discovered that zymase stimulates fermentation, showing that fermentation
                    is stimulated by intracellular enzymes. Eduard Buchner also discovered that fermentation occurs outside living cells as well</p>
                <h3 style="color: brown;">anthrax vaccine </h3>
                <p>Pasteur publicly claimed success in developing an anthrax vaccine in 1881. In any case, it was Henri Toussaint, admirer turned competitor, who developed the first vaccine. Toussaint isolated the bacteria that caused chicken cholera (later
                    named Pasteurella in honor of Pasteur) in 1879 and gave Pasteur samples for his work. Toussaint presented his successful results to the French Academy of Sciences on July 12, 1880, using an attenuated vaccine against anthrax in dogs
                    and sheep. Jealously, Pasteur opposed this discovery and introduced his method of vaccination in the village of Pouilly-le-Fort on May 5, 1881. Pasteur then gave a misleading account of the preparation of the anthrax vaccine used in
                    the experiment, claiming that he had made a "live vaccine", but that he used potassium dichromate to kill the vaccine; The method is similar to the Toussaint method. The promotional experience was successful and helped Pasteur sell
                    his products and reap the benefits and glory.</p>
                <h3 style="color: brown;">Experimental Ethics</h3>
                <p>
                    Pasteur's experiments are often cited as conflicting with medical ethics, especially when it comes to the fact that Maestre's child was vaccinated. Pasteur had no experience in medical practice, nor a medical license; Facts often threatened his professional
                    and personal reputation. His closest partner, Émile Roux, who has medical qualifications, declined to participate in the clinical trial, likely because he saw it as unfair. In any case, Pasteur vaccinated the child under the close
                    supervision of medical practitioners Jacques Joseph Grencher, head of the pediatric clinic at the Children's Hospital in Paris, and Alfred Vulpien, a member of the rabies committee. He was not allowed to carry the syringe, though the
                    vaccination was done entirely under his supervision; Grencher took charge of the injections, and he defended Pasteur before the French National Academy of Medicine in the case. Pasteur has been criticized for keeping his procedures
                    secret and for not carrying out proper preclinical experiments on animals. Pasteur stated that he kept his procedures secret in order to control their quality. He later revealed his procedures to a small group of scientists. Pasteur
                    wrote that he had successfully vaccinated 50 dogs with rabies before using it on Meister, but Pasteur's lab records say he vaccinated only 11 dogs, says Gayson. Meister showed no symptoms of rabies, without proving that vaccination
                    caused it. One source estimates that Meister will have rabies at 10 percent.</p>

                <h3 style="color: brown;">Awards and Honors</h3>
                <p>
                    Pasteur received 1,500 francs in 1853 from the Pharmaceutical Society for his success in the synthesis of racemic acid. The Royal Society of London awarded him the Rumford Medal in 1856 for his discovery of the nature of racemic acid and its relationship
                    to polarized light, and the Copley Medal in 1874 for his work in fermentation. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1869. The French Academy of Sciences awarded Pasteur in 1859 the Montion Prize for Experimental
                    Physiology in 1860, the Jecker Prize in 1861 and the Humbert Prize in 1862 for his refutation of spontaneous generation by experiment. Although he lost the 1857 and 1861 elections to the French Academy of Sciences, Pasteur won the
                    1862 elections to the Department of Mineralogy. He was elected permanent secretary of the Academy's Department of Physical Sciences in 1887 and held this position until 1889. In 1873 Pasteur was elected to the National Academy of Medicine
                    and was awarded the Brazilian Order of the Rose, with the rank of Commander. In 1881 he was elected to a seat at the French Academy that Émile Létty had left vacant. Pasteur was awarded the Order of Albert by the Royal Society of Arts
                    in 1882, and in 1883 he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1885 he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. The Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II granted him the Majidi
                    Nishan (first degree) on June 8, 1886, in addition to 10,000 Ottoman liras. He won the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics from the University of Edinburgh in 1889. The year 1895 saw Pasteur win the Leeuwenhoek Medal from the Royal Netherlands
                    Academy of Arts and Sciences for his contributions to microbiology. Pasteur was awarded the Legion of Honor in 1853, then was promoted to officer in 1863, then to captain in 1868, to great captain in 1878, and finally to the rank of
                    Grand Cross in 1881.</p>
                <h3 style="color: brown;">His last days and his death </h3>
                <p>Pasteur died in 1895 near Paris from complications from a series of strokes that began in 1868. He died while listening to the story of Saint Paul de Vincent. He was buried in Notre Dame, but his remains have been reburied in the vault
                    of the Institut Pasteur in Paris, where people remember his life-saving work.</p>
